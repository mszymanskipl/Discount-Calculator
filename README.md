# Discount-Calculator

This is my take on the discount calculator case study.

Assumptions:
* Price is given in cents (as it's an int, and also a common practice in e-commerce systems)
* The cart will be in one currency.
* Discounts apply to a pre-discount price

Usage is demonstrated inside the `DiscountCalculatorTest` class.
